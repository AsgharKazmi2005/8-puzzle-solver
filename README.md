# A*-based 8-Puzzle Solver

To get it to work on your system locally, clone this repository. Once cloned, run the app.py file in the backend folder
to create the endpoint to which the A* algorithm will respond with the solution.

```
python backend/app.py
```

Then run the frontend with 

```
npm run dev
```

Now you should be able to both play the game as a user or click the A* Solve button to see A* solve the puzzle.
